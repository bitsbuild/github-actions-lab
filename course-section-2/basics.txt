GitHub Actions Structure

1. Repository

    Can have multiple workflows (`.github/workflows/.yml`).

2. Workflow

    Defined in a YAML file.
    Triggered by events like `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, or `manual`.
    Can contain one or more jobs.
    Represents a process or CI/CD pipeline.

3. Job

    Runs on a runner/environment (like `ubuntu-latest` or `windows-latest`).
    Contains one or more steps.
    Jobs run in parallel by default, unless dependencies are specified.

4. Step

    Smallest unit of execution.
    Can be a shell command or an action.
    Steps are executed sequentially within a job.
